var thoughts=\"\"\"
	Ok, let's think about enemy generation...
	At level 1, the player should have 3 extra status points, 
	as well as the given 1 point in every stat. 
	
	That means that, at level 1, 
	each enemy to be created should have at max 3 points distribuited...
	let's say that the player has the choice of fighting an
	easier, a medium, and a harder enemy, with different rewards.
	Therefore, we could have an enemy with 2 points, one with 3,
	and one with 4.
	We could also have two with 2 points, and one with 3.
	Maybe the level 1 fight could be less random: we could fix
	that there will always be 2 weaker enemies, and one stronger.
	
	Now, to level 2.
	By now the player should have a total of 6 applied points, and 
	a reasonable amount of gold. We want the player to keep
	fighting, so let's stick to 2 weaker enemies, and 1 stronger.
	
	For level 3, let's keep things this way. Maybe we should have
	just one weaker enemies, and the two others should be on the same
	level as the player.
	
	Now, at the start of level 4, the player should have finally
	evolved... which means he's a lot stronger by now. We could
	ramp the difficulty by now. Let's keep a weaker enemy and
	two strong ones, that might be evolved as well.
	
	At level 5, we still have a weak enemy, but now the other
	two enemies are evolved and at the same level as the player.
	The game still is balanced because the player still can choose
	its opponents, and we can make sure that they are different
	from each other, in a way that the player can choose to
	not be in a bad matchup.
	At least for now, we have
	Strength > Agility > Defense > Strength;
	Also, at level 5, there's the chance that we could include a
	miniboss. That way, we could either have 3 enemies with one
	being the miniboss (that will have a good reward), or just
	a miniboss, with no choice.
	We could also have 1 weak, 1 medium, and 1 stronger.
	That should be fine I guess.
	
	Level 6 could be a turning point... we could have one enemy at
	the player's level, and two others that are stronger. Again,
	because of the balancing, the player still could win against 
	stronger enemies.
	
	At the beginning of level 7, the player evolves again. Since
	the pigeon should be a lot stronger by now, we can ramp the 
	difficulty, but make it a easy win, both to give a resting
	time to the player, as to let him regain resources.
	This reminds me of changing classes in Shining Force II...
	it always was so badass to see your allies get strong 
	as heck.
	
	Well, at level 8, the game gets harder again. Let's have
	3 enemies at the same level by now.
	
	At level 9, let's have the same pattern.
	
	Finally, at level 10, we have the game's boss.
	
	So... in the end, we have:
		LV1		2W 1M
		LV2		2W 1M
		LV3		1W 2M
		LV4		1W 2M
		LV5		1W 2M/1W 1M 1S/MIDBOSS
		LV6		2M 1S
		LV7		2M 1S
		LV8		3S
		LV9		3S
		LV10	FINALBOSS
